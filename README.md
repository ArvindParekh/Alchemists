## Learnings 🌿

Throughout the development process, we encountered significant challenges:

- Mobile App Conversion: Converting our Next.js code to a mobile app using Capacitor demanded considerable time and effort. Also, it introduced a log of new bugs and wasn't really compatible with the feature we were targeting, so we dropped it midway and thought of adopting the PWA approach. We overcame hurdles in ensuring a seamless transition between web and mobile platforms.

- API Integration: Working with Vonage and Gemini APIs presented real hassles, requiring thorough understanding and troubleshooting. We learned valuable lessons in handling API complexities and enhancing system reliability.
